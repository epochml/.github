# Epoch

Epoch is IMSA's **only general computer science club.** 

* We operate a cluster, a set of networked computers with significant computational resources that allow students to carry out tasks they normally could not, like intense machine learning, heavy physics simulations, or detailed graphics rendering. We host educational workshops
* Epoch hosts educational workshops for IMSA students that cover topics from Introductory Programming to Cybersecurity, depending on the interest of students
* Students can get their projects sponsored by Epoch to get access to cluster resources, a subdomain of epochml.org, and support from other Epoch members.
